# dotfiles
This repo contains my personal dotfiles.

## Clone the repo to your home directory and run these commands there to point your dotfiles to the repo. It may be a good idea to make backups beforehand.

###vimrc
`echo "source ~/dotfiles/vimrc`

###bash_profile
`echo "source ~/dotfiles/bash_profile`

###bashrc
`echo "source ~/dotfiles/bashrc`
